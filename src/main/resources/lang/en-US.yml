# A note on editing this file.
# ----------------------------
#
# Do not alter this file if it is in the reference folder.
# Before you edit this file, read about how Towny handles 
# language files:

#
#
# A note on text formatting (how Towny inserts words.)
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# You MUST retain spacing in the texts.
# If a text begins or ends with a space, it must remain that
# way.
#
#      %s = data to be supplied by the plugin.
#
# If you find that a line has multiple %s variables which would
# be in a different order in your language, you can change them
# to %1$s, %2$s, %4$s, %3$s to change their order. ie: %4$s
# will always use the 4th variable, no matter where it is
# placed on the line.
#
#
# A note on text colouring and formatting.
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Black = &0, Navy = &1, Green = &2, Blue = &3, Red = &4
# Purple = &5, Gold = &6, LightGray = &7, Gray = &8
# DarkPurple = &9, LightGreen = &a, LightBlue = &b
